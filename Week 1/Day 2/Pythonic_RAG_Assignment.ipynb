            "\n",
            "1. **Use List Comprehensions When Possible**:\n",
            "   If you're constructing a list, consider using a list comprehension instead of a traditional for loop. It’s more concise and often more efficient.\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   # Instead of this:\n",
            "   squares = []\n",
            "   for i in range(10):\n",
            "       squares.append(i ** 2)\n",
            "\n",
            "   # You can do this:\n",
            "   squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(10)]\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Use the `enumerate()` Function**:\n",
            "   If you need both the index and the value from a list, use `enumerate()` to keep your loop clean.\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
            "   for index, value in enumerate(my_list):\n",
            "       print(index, value)\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Prefer `for` Loops Over `while` Loops**: \n",
            "   When iterating over collections (like lists, tuples, or dictionaries), use a `for` loop. It's more Pythonic and typically less prone to errors than using a `while` loop.\n",

            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Avoid Modifying the List While Iterating**:\n",
            "   Modifying the list you are iterating over can lead to unexpected behavior. If you need to remove items while iterating, consider creating a copy of the list or using list comprehensions.\n",
            "\n",

            "   # Avoid this:\n",

            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Control Loop Execution with `break` and `continue`**:\n",
            "   Use `break` to exit a loop early, or `continue` to skip the current iteration. This can help keep your loop logic clear.\n",
            "\n",
