[ToolMessage(content='Published: 2023-05-23\nTitle: QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs\nAuthors: Tim Dettmers, Artidoro Pagnoni, Ari Holtzman, Luke Zettlemoyer\nSummary: We present QLoRA, an efficient finetuning approach that reduces memory usage\nenough to finetune a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU while preserving\nfull 16-bit finetuning task performance. QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\n4-bit training.

However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.
